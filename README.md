# Olympic Data Analysis and Visualization in Power Bi

# Description
This project involves the analysis of Olympic data using PowerBI. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results] and cleaned within PowerBI. Various visualizations were created to explore different aspects of the data, including the distribution of medals by gender, top-performing countries, and trends over the years.
